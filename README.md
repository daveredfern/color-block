# Color Block
A WordPress theme for a small portfolio.

## Getting started
This theme uses gulp to process front end assets. Preprocessing is based on Jake Cobleys work https://github.com/JakeCobley/gulpfile.js.

To start working:

1. `CD` to directory of the theme.
2. Run `npm install`. This can take a few minutes.
3. Run one of the following commands `npm run watch` or `npm run build` to begin watching or building the files.

## Demo
See a demo of this theme at https://karenuppal.co.uk/. 

## Support and questions
This theme is for my personal site. I am trying to make it as generic as possible so anyone can use it. If you have any questions feel free to contact me. https://daveredfern.com/contact/
